# Multi-Cloud-Landing-Zone

Multi-Cloud Landing Zone - Automation and Observability Framework
Overview
This project provides a robust, scalable, and secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework for deploying standardized landing zones across hybrid cloud environments, specifically AWS and Azure. It leverages Python for orchestration, Terraform for declarative infrastructure provisioning, and integrates with Azure DevOps for CI/CD automation.

This framework is designed to meet the demands of modern cloud operations by automating the creation of secure, multi-account structures with proper network segmentation and built-in hooks for continuous monitoring and observability. It directly addresses the need for resilient, secure, and efficient cloud environments as outlined in the target job description.

Key Features
Multi-Cloud Deployment: Natively supports both AWS and Azure from a single, unified codebase.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Utilizes Terraform to define, version, and manage infrastructure, ensuring consistency and eliminating manual configuration errors.

Automated Orchestration: A central Python script manages the entire deployment lifecycle, from initialization to applying infrastructure changes.

Secure by Design: Implements foundational security principles, including network segmentation (VNet/VPC with public/private subnets) and placeholder security rules (NSGs).

CI/CD Integration: Includes a pre-configured Azure DevOps pipeline (azure-pipelines.yml) for automated, trigger-based deployments.

Observability Ready: Contains placeholder functions to integrate with essential monitoring and security services like Azure Sentinel, Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, and AWS GuardDuty.

Project Structure
A clean, scalable structure is used to keep cloud-specific code organized and maintainable.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this framework locally, you will need:

Python 3.8+

Terraform CLI

Azure CLI

AWS CLI

An active Azure Subscription with permissions to create resources.

An active AWS Account with permissions to create resources.

Setup & Configuration
Clone the Repository:

git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd <repository-name>

Install Python Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Cloud Credentials:
The framework uses environment variables to authenticate with AWS and Azure. This is suitable for local development and CI/CD environments.

For Azure:
Create a Service Principal and export its credentials:

export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<your-azure-client-id>"
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-azure-client-secret>"
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-azure-subscription-id>"
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<your-azure-tenant-id>"

For AWS:
Configure your AWS access keys:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your-aws-access-key-id>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your-aws-secret-access-key>"

Note: For production use, it is highly recommended to use more secure methods like Azure Key Vault for secrets management and OIDC for federated authentication.

Running the Framework
With the prerequisites installed and credentials configured, execute the main Python script to deploy the infrastructure:

python main.py

The script will perform the following actions:

Execute terraform init, plan, and apply for the Azure resources.

Call the configure_azure_monitoring function.

Execute terraform init, plan, and apply for the AWS resources.

Call the configure_aws_monitoring function.

Aligning with Core Cloud Engineering Competencies
This project is a direct, hands-on demonstration of the skills required for a modern Cloud Engineer role:

Requirement from Job Description

How This Project Demonstrates It

Multi-Cloud Environment Experience

Manages infrastructure across both AWS & Azure in a single, cohesive framework.

IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation)

Uses Terraform as the core IaC tool for declarative, version-controlled infrastructure.

CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, GitLab)

Implements a complete CI/CD workflow using Azure DevOps Pipelines.

Landing Zone Architectures

Designs and deploys foundational landing zones with multi-account strategies and network segmentation.

Cloud Observability & Resilience

Includes dedicated functions for integrating monitoring and security tools, a key SRE principle.

Python Scripting

Leverages Python for automation and orchestration, gluing together various tools and platforms.

Git & GitFlow

The entire project is structured for version control with Git, following standard repository organization.

Future Enhancements
Containerization: Add Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests to deploy a sample application into the provisioned infrastructure.

Advanced Security: Implement more granular Network Security Group (NSG) and AWS Security Group rules. Integrate with Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

State Management: Configure Terraform to use a remote backend (like an Azure Storage Account or an S3 bucket) for state file management, which is essential for team collaboration.

Full Observability Integration: Flesh out the monitoring functions to fully configure Azure Sentinel and AWS GuardDuty with alerts and logging.
